### dspsr PFB inversion verification

The code in this repo is designed to test and verify the PFB inversion
implementation in [`dspsr`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dspsr/).
Moreover, this code attempts to reproduce the verification pipeline set up
by Ian Morrison [here](https://github.com/SKA-PST/PST_Matlab_channelizer_inverter_purity_measurement_CDR).
